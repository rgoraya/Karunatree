  %h1 Welcome
  %p KarunaTree is an interactive narrative world for kids, designed to help them understand and respond to the serious environmental challenges facing our planet. Our goal is to do more than simply educate young people about sustainability; rather, we hope to empower children to have a voice in their own environmental future.
  %p We're currently in development, but please check back soon! We expect to have our first public beta later this year.
  %p To follow our progress, please check out <span class="yellow-highlight"><a href="http://www.karunatree.com/canopy" title="Canopy">Canopy</a></span> the KarunaTree project blog!
