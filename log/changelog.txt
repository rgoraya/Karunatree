* Improved Play Controller's handling of story display on login. Current scene now loads script and GE view.
* Improved Play Controller's handling of back/next navigation. Buttons now display only when content is available.
* Scenes now know whether they have associated KTX, and KTX load calls are made appropriately
* Story div snaps back to the top when script is refreshed
* First pass at simple caching with KtxCache version 0.1: top*level Camera/LookAt for each scene is locally cached, then redisplayed if user goes back to a previously viewed scene
