* Greatly improved logic for adding/retrieving KML data to/from the plugin. Plugin now handles caching of AbstractViews
* KtxCache has been streamlined, as this class now only needs to store KTX command values and not entire nodes (i.e. Cameras or LookAts)
* Significant refinements throughout the KML loading pipeline
* GoogleEarth now handles interpretation of KTX commands retrieved from KtxCache itself (rather than relying on KtxInterpreter)
* KtxInterpreter has been deprecated. Functionality distributed to KmlManager (formerly KtxManager) and GoogleEarth
* Significant refactoring of ktree.ktx package (now ktree.kml)
* Illustration display bugs that formerly arose with repeated forward/back navigation have been resolved
* First pass at persistent story state!
* GoogleEarth automatically serializes plugin's KML state to server on each update; saved KML state is restored when user returns, including re-initialization of all KTX commands
* Added new illustration assets
* Updated JsDocs; added JsDoc configuration file to docs subdirectory


** Version 0.5d2 **
Begun: 1.5.10
Committed: 1.7.10
Corresponding SVN Revisions: 21

* Added Sound models to the Rails side to help specify details of how music, ambient sounds, and effects should playback
* Play controller now uses JSON to transmit Sound models to Soundscape
* Soundscape.fadeIn blends incoming JSON Sound objects with default parameters to manage sound playback
* Music and ambient sound can now persist across scenes when appropriate without interruption
* New music and ambient tracks added to the sound content directory
* A first, highly unprincipled and temporary pass at attaching illustrations to Placemarks (see ktree.GoogleEarth.postProcessFeatures_())
* Illustration content directory added
* Added file and system version numbering

* Improved Play Controller's handling of story display on login. Current scene now loads script and GE view.
* Improved Play Controller's handling of back/next navigation. Buttons now display only when content is available.
* Scenes now know whether they have associated KTX, and KTX load calls are made appropriately
* Story div snaps back to the top when script is refreshed
* First pass at simple caching with KtxCache version 0.1: top*level Camera/LookAt for each scene is locally cached, then redisplayed if user goes back to a previously viewed scene
